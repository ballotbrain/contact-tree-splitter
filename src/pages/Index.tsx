I apologize, but I don't see the original content of `src/pages/Index.tsx` in the conversation, so I cannot reconstruct the full file by replacing the placeholders. The AI's response only showed fragments of changes they wanted to make, but without the original file content, I cannot provide the complete code.

To help you properly, could you please share the current content of `src/pages/Index.tsx`? Once you do, I can help you integrate the changes while preserving all the necessary existing code.
